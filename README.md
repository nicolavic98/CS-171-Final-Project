CS 171 Final Project


This project serves to analyze the current situation of the US Postsecondary Education system, from a lens of enrolled students, their ethnicities, their majors, and the costs/financial assistance associated with university education. Our website investigates this data over multiple decades, and most of the data referenced comes from the National Center for Education Statistics at https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/current_tables.asp?fbclid=IwAR1ag2pLsqhgISTzNhmfBZ4maY4iOApHYl6OxQ-oY_VwA2JOyisHVY-iClI, with a focus on Chapter 3.
